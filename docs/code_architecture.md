# Code Architecture

The code architecture of the Auto Email Responder project follows a modular and organized structure. Here is an overview of the different components and their responsibilities:

## Directory Structure

- `config/`: This directory contains configuration files for the project.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files for the project.
- `tests/`: This directory contains test files for the project.

## Components

### Response Generator

The `response_generator.py` file in the `src/` directory contains the code for generating email responses using the OpenAI API. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate natural language responses based on the input email.

### Meeting Scheduler

The `meeting_scheduler.py` file in the `src/` directory contains the code for scheduling meetings using the Zoom API. It provides functions to create and manage Zoom meetings, allowing users to schedule meetings programmatically.

### Draft Manager

The `draft_manager.py` file in the `src/` directory contains the code for managing email drafts using the Gmail API. It provides functions to create, update, and delete email drafts, allowing users to manage drafts programmatically.

### Account Manager

The `account_manager.py` file in the `src/` directory contains the code for managing email accounts using the Gmail API. It provides functions to authenticate and manage email accounts, including obtaining access tokens and refreshing credentials.

## Conclusion

The code architecture of the Auto Email Responder project promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Each component is responsible for a specific functionality, allowing for easy extension and customization. By following this architecture, the project can be easily maintained and scaled in the future.
